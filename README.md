Sanguine Full Stack Developer Gauntlet 
======================================

Fork this repo and create an application that will use the data from http://devtest.sanginebio.com/API 
and create a single page application that will render the data in a way that is informative and visually
appealing. Extra points for interactive data rendering (Filter, etc.). The API route is running on some 
screwed up hardware that may go out peridiocially, so make sure you cache the data every now and again. 
When you are finished, post the public url to your live app in the README file in the root directory. 
You can use any language you want, and you get extra points for the external API's that you use. Extra 
points if it works for mobile also. Extra points for well documented code. Extra points for a 
good git-workflow. 

Good Luck!
